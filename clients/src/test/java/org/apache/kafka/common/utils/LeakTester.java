/**
 * Interface for leak-checkers which evaluates an execution interval and throws an exception if resources were leaked.
 * <p>A test interval is the time between {@link LeakTester#start()} and {@link LeakTest#close()}. A leak-checker
 * should consider a resource leaked if it is opened during the interval, but not closed during that interval.
 * Implementations of this interface should be thread-safe.
 *
 * <p>For example, the following situation would :
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * LeakTester tester = ; // some implementation
 * AutoCloseable resource;
 * try (LeakTest test : tester.start()) {
 *     resource = () -> {};
 *     tester.register(resource); // pseudocode
 *     resource.close(); // If this is missing, a leak will be detected.
 * } catch (AssertionError e) {
 *     // We leaked a resource!
 * }
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of LeakTester will have different ways of registering resources for tracking. For example,
 * A LeakTester that is also a Factory could automatically register all resources created by the factory method(s).
 * A LeakTester could also maintain static methods which allows registration from deeper in the call stack.
 * Implementations of LeakTester will also have different ways of testing if resources are closed, depending on the
 * specifics of the resource they are tracking.
